My name is Misaki. I was born and raised in Japan. 
I have many experiences for teaching Japanese when I was living in Australia.I have taught beginner students as well as advanced students who were interested in conversation.I also have taught English to Japanese children, so I’m comfortable with using English as well. 
I can help you with practicing speaking, listening, reading and writing.I usually offer a lesson for one hour, but I can do half hour lesson depends on your age and level.
I love traveling around the world and am interested in learning other languages. I currently am learning Italian by myself.  Through my past trips, I learned lots of cultural differences between Japan and other countries. I would like to share some in a lesson, if you’d like.
